# Fourier Analysis

## Fourier-Series:
- is the `Presentation` of `periodic signals` using `exponential-`, or `Sin waves`
- A combination of multiple waves.
- A sum of Waves of different frequencies
> Every `Periodic` Function can be approximated by a `Sum of waves` of `Different frequencies`
> Cables act like a `low-pass filter`, and can not transport waves of high frequencies

## Dirichlet-Condition
 - A `Condition` which a signal must meet in order for it to be presented in a `Fourier Reihe`
