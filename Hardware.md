## Switch:
- uses `MAC address` to forward `data frames` to the correct device within a network
- connects multiple devices in a `LAN`

## Bridge
- connects 2 or more `LANs` creating a `single unified network`
- forwards `frames` based on `MAC addresses`
- reduce network traffic and segment a network
